# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, implemented in Rust.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. Each day from December 1 to December 25, a new challenge is released.

## About This Repository

This repository is my attempt at tackling the Advent of Code 2024 challenges using Rust. It serves as a personal learning journey to improve my Rust skills and have fun solving interesting problems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
aoc_2024/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day01.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day02.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ day25.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ input/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day01.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day02.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ day25.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day01_test.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day02_test.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ day25_test.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **src/**: Contains the Rust source files for each day's challenge.
- **input/**: Contains the input files for each day's challenge.
- **tests/**: Contains the test files for each day's challenge.
- **Cargo.toml**: The Cargo configuration file.

## How to Run

To run the solutions for a specific day, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin dayXX
```

Replace `XX` with the day number (e.g., `01` for day 1).

## How to Test

To run the tests for a specific day, use the following command:

```bash
cargo test --test dayXX_test
```

Replace `XX` with the day number (e.g., `01` for day 1).
